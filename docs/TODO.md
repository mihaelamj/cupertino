#  TODO:

## 1. SampleCodeCatalog - All Known Apple Sample Files

- convert it to json
- add date (last crawled 17.11.2025.)
- add to resources
- add test to confirm reading is correct

## 2. All Swift Packages
- currnetly I have crawled all github swift packages
- the operation first crawled Swift Pacjage Index
- then it crawled package metadata from GitHub
- the data from that crawl is available in folder:
/Volumes/Code/DeveloperExt/cupertino_test/packages/checkpoint.json
- that file should also be copied to the project - resources
- renamed
- date added (last crawled 17.11.2025.)

## 3. Question:
- what do sample codes have url like this:
```
      "url" : "\/documentation\/GameKit\/adding-recurring-leaderboards-to-your-game",
```
- why is `documentation` hardcoded ?
- look at the /Volumes/Code/DeveloperExt/cupertino_test folder
- there we have all (ideal) downloads

## 4. document commands
- one by one in separate files, in documents
