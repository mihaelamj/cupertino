# .auth-cookies.json

Authentication cookies for Apple Developer downloads

## Location

```
~/.cupertino/sample-code/.auth-cookies.json
```

## Purpose

Stores authentication cookies for downloading Apple sample code that requires Apple Developer account access.

## Created By

```bash
cupertino fetch --type code --authenticate
```

The `--authenticate` flag launches a visible browser where you can sign in to your Apple Developer account. After authentication, cookies are saved to this file for future use.

## Format

JSON file containing browser cookies:

```json
{
  "cookies": [
    {
      "name": "cookie_name",
      "value": "cookie_value",
      "domain": ".apple.com",
      "path": "/",
      "secure": true,
      "httpOnly": true
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-11-19T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Security

⚠️ **This file contains authentication credentials!**

- File is prefixed with `.` to hide it
- Contains sensitive session data
- Should NOT be committed to version control
- Cookies may expire and require re-authentication

## Behavior

- **With cookies**: Sample code downloads run headlessly (faster)
- **Without cookies**: Use `--authenticate` to sign in via visible browser
- **Expired cookies**: Re-run with `--authenticate` to refresh
