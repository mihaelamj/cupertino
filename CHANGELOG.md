## Unreleased: v1.0.1

### Fixed

- **URL canonicalization: case-axis duplicates collapse at index time** ([#200](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/200), supersedes [#201](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/pull/201)): the crawler queue, the on-disk corpus, and the search-index save layer now collapse case-axis URL variants. `Crawler` normalizes URLs on session restore, on technology-index seed, and on the start-URL fallback; the in-flight queue check additionally compares against any normalized form of an enqueued URL so case-flip duplicates don't re-enter. `SearchIndexBuilder` gained a `deduplicateDocFilesByCanonicalURL` step that reads each doc's canonical URL out of the saved JSON (decoder configured with `.iso8601`, mirroring `indexStructuredDocument`) and keeps the file with the newest `crawledAt` when two files share a canonical URL after normalization. URI generation prefers the page's own URL (post-normalize) over the file path. Underscore→dash collapse was deliberately **not** added at the URLUtilities layer because at least one Apple framework (`installer_js`) requires the underscore. Verified that `documentation/installer-js` returns 404 from Apple. Locked in by a regression test (`URLUtilities normalize keeps underscores intact`). New test suite `IndexBuilderDeduplicationTests` covers the dedup helper directly: keep-newest-by-`crawledAt`-not-mtime, single-file pass-through, distinct-URLs-both-survive, and `loadStructuredPage` `.iso8601` round-trip. Co-authored with [@imwyvern](https://github.com/imwyvern) (Wesley), whose [#201](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/pull/201) supplied the crawler queue dedup, dedup helper, URI alignment, and case-axis tests. **Re-index required** to materialize the lowercase canonical URIs across the corpus; no re-crawl needed (full `cupertino save` over the v1.0 corpus is ~12 hours on a Mac Studio M4 Max, longer on smaller machines; rebuild time is dominated by AST extraction over Swift code blocks plus FTS5 BM25F indexing across docs.db, packages.db, and samples.db).
- **`cupertino search --source packages` returns 0 results** ([#261](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/261)): the `--source` dispatch in `SearchCommand.run()` lumped `packages` together with the doc-shaped sources (`apple-docs`, `apple-archive`, `swift-evolution`, `swift-org`, `swift-book`) and routed them all to `runDocsSearch`, which queries `search.db` only. Packages live in their own DB (`packages.db`) with their own fetcher (`PackageFTSCandidateFetcher`); querying `search.db` for `source = 'packages'` rows always returned empty. The unified fan-out path correctly opened `packages.db` via `openPackagesFetcher`, so default search returned package results, masking the bug. `--source packages` now routes to a new `runPackageSearch` runner that wraps `Search.PackageFTSCandidateFetcher` in a single-fetcher `Search.SmartQuery` and renders through the same `printSmartReport` formatter as the default fan-out. Output JSON shape is `{candidates, contributingSources: ["packages"], question}`, consistent with the unified search rather than the per-source list views. Honors `--platform` / `--min-version` filters and `--packages-db` override. Verified: `cupertino search "alamofire" --source packages` was returning 5 bytes (`[]\n`); now returns SourceKitten / SWXMLHash / package-collection results.

### Changed

- **Cupertino skill (`skills/cupertino/SKILL.md`) gained query-strategy + verification guidance** ([#260](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/pull/260)): the previous version was a thin command reference. The new version teaches the LLM to translate descriptive queries to canonical Apple terms before searching (translation table for SwiftUI / UIKit / AppKit primitives), handle typos itself (cupertino does exact lexical matching, not fuzzy), infer framework from context, prefer current API over deprecated, recover when results are weak (paradigm bridge / conceptual phrasing / samples corpus), and surface what was tried instead of silently rewriting. Added a citation-and-verification section: cite-as-you-go for every API mention (~5% token overhead, prevents most API-knowledge hallucinations), re-search uncertain claims as needed, never fabricate parameters / return types / availability. Also corrects the example JSON shapes to match cupertino's actual response (`candidates` / `identifier` / `question`, not the previously-claimed `results` / `uri` / `count` / `query` keys), documents per-source view shapes, and refreshes doc count from 300k to 405k pages.

### Internal

- **`CLAUDE.md` refreshed for v1.0.1** ([#263](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/pull/263)): post-First-Light state (closed the v1.0.0 phase framing, listed the v1.0.1 milestone bugs, replaced the dead `fix/all-open-bugs-2026-04` branch reference with the trunk-based per-bug workflow). v1.1+ research notes now point at `mihaela-blog-ideas/cupertino/research/`.

---

## 1.0.0 "First Light" — 2026-05-05

_The first release we'd call properly stable. Consolidates what was originally scoped as v0.11.0 (packages-overhaul) + v0.12.0 (docs-overhaul) into a single cut. Release plan: [#192](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/192). Canonical roadmap: [#183](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/183)._

### Search ranking — canonical type queries land their canonical answer

A multi-pass ranker rewrite for the smart-query fan-out + the apple-docs source. Pre-1.0 the default `cupertino search Task` returned a Mach kernel C-function essay; post-1.0 it returns the Swift `Task` struct, and the same shape holds for every common single-token type query (Task, View, URLSession, Color, String, Result, Array, Optional, Image, Text, URL, Data, Date, Sequence, AsyncSequence, Hashable, Codable, Comparable, Equatable, Sendable, Identifiable, …). 34 of 35 canonical queries land their canonical apple-docs page at fused #1 against the v1.0 corpus (the holdout, `Stack`, has no canonical Swift / SwiftUI / Foundation type and resolves to `tvml/Stack` correctly).

- **Intent-routed fan-out** ([#254](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/254)): `Search.SmartQuery` detects symbol-shaped queries (single token, ≥2 chars, ASCII identifier, leading uppercase) and prunes the fetcher set to apple-docs + swift-evolution + packages before fan-out. Prose queries keep the all-source path. Stops apple-archive's "Common Tasks in OS X" essay from tying with Swift's `Task` struct on the fused rank.
- **Authority-weighted RRF** ([#254](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/254)): replaces plain RRF's `1/(k+r)` with `weight[source]/(k+r)`. apple-docs 3.0, swift-evolution / packages 1.5, swift-book / swift-org 1.0, apple-archive / hig 0.5. Cross-source rank-1 ties resolve without per-query intent routing carrying the whole load.
- **HEURISTIC 1 split** ([#254](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/254)): the suffixed " | Apple Developer Documentation" title marks Apple's parent landing page for a type. Suffixed pages get a 50× exact-title boost; clean-titled siblings keep the previous 20×. Flips canonical-vs-sub-symbol order on the apple-docs side without touching BM25F weights.
- **HEURISTIC 1.5 — exact-title peer tiebreak** ([#256](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/256)): when multiple apple-docs pages all hit the exact-title boost (e.g. `Result` matches Swift's enum, Vision's associated type, Installer JS's runtime type), URI-simplicity (top-level type page vs sub-symbol) and a narrow framework-authority map (`Search.Index.frameworkAuthority`) break the tie. Fires only inside the exact-title branch — does not crowd out framework-specific symbol queries (`VisionRequest` still resolves to `vision/VisionRequest`).
- **Force-include canonical type pages past fetchLimit** ([#256](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/256) follow-on): for top-tier frameworks (swift, swiftui, foundation), `Search.Index.fetchCanonicalTypePages` hand-fetches `apple-docs://FRAMEWORK/documentation_FRAMEWORK_QUERY` directly by URI. Probes by docs_metadata PK (5 ms), not an FTS5 scan. Catches canonicals BM25 buries past the candidate cutoff (Foundation `URL` at raw rank 1017, Swift `Identifiable` at 2577, Foundation `Data` past 3000).
- **`doc_symbols_fts` post-rank sign error** ([#254](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/254)): `result.rank * 0.3` on a negative BM25 rank was a *demotion*, not the documented "3x boost". Changed to `* 3.0`. Canonical Swift types have AST symbols indexed; kernel C functions don't, so the sign error was silently letting kernel C functions outrank Swift types.
- **`fetchLimit` floor at 1000** ([#254](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/254)): smart-query fan-out used to over-fetch only 200 rows; canonical Swift `Task` struct sits at raw BM25 position 241, never made the candidate set. Floor at 1000, ceiling 2000.
- **packages.db canonical-repo force-include**: when query tokens (or their dash-joined form) match an indexed `repo` name exactly, `Search.PackageQuery` fetches that repo's top BM25 file as a force-included candidate. Catches `vapor middleware` → vapor/vapor (was swift-openapi-generator), `swift testing` → swiftlang/swift-testing, `swift dependencies` → pointfreeco/swift-dependencies. Two-tier match: dashed forms (`swift-testing`) outrank single-token forms (`swift`) so `swift testing` doesn't pull in swiftlang/swift via the bare token.
- **Search.Index DB lock fix**: every `Search.Index.init` used to issue an unconditional `PRAGMA user_version = N` write — two parallel `cupertino search` invocations contended on the open-time write lock and one would fail with `database is locked` (SQLite's default `busy_timeout` is 0). `setSchemaVersion` now read-then-write (skips the PRAGMA when version already matches) and `sqlite3_busy_timeout(db, 5000)` is set right after open so any future contention degrades to a wait-then-succeed.
- **Search perf — canonical/framework-root probes use docs_metadata PK**: the `fetchCanonicalTypePages` and `fetchFrameworkRoot` helpers used to query `docs_fts` with `WHERE f.uri = ?`, which forced a full FTS5 scan (3.2 s per probe on the v1.0 corpus). Now query `docs_metadata` only, with title/summary read via `json_extract(json_data, '$.title' / '$.abstract')`. 5 ms per probe — single-process search wall time on the 3.4 GB corpus dropped from ~18 s to ~4 s.
- **Field-weighted BM25 (BM25F) on apple-docs** ([#181](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/181), subsumes earlier title-weight work): per-column weights `bm25(docs_fts, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 10.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0)` — title 10×, AST-derived symbols 5×, summary 3×, framework 2×. The retrieval foundation the heuristics above sit on top of.

### Distribution — single-bundle release

- **All three databases ship in one bundle** on `mihaelamj/cupertino-docs`: `cupertino-databases-vX.zip` contains `search.db` + `samples.db` + `packages.db`. The earlier scoping had a separate `mihaelamj/cupertino-packages` companion repo for `packages.db`; that repo proved to be needless complexity (same crawl, same schedule, two release tags) and is gone. `cupertino setup` is one download + one extract.
- **`cupertino-rel databases`** ([#259](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/259)): the release tool bundles all three DBs into a single zip and uploads to the docs repo. Hard-fails if `packages.db` is missing under `--base-dir` unless `--allow-missing-packages` is passed (lets a release runner publish a partial bundle in time-sensitive cases without making it the default). Generic publishing primitives (zip, sha256, GitHub API, upload progress, token resolution) factored into a shared `ReleasePublishing` helper.
- **`cupertino setup` rewrites the pipeline** to a single download + extract + version stamp. Removes the previous "docs zip → extract → packages zip → extract → soft-fail-if-missing" path. All three DBs are now required post-extract; any missing DB is a hard fail rather than a warning. (#246 lifted SetupCommand's logic into a `Distribution` package; this release simplifies the pipeline that lift exposed.)
- **`cupertino setup` backs up existing DBs** before overwrite ([#249](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/249)): each pre-existing DB renames to a `.backup-<version>-<iso8601>` sibling before extraction would clobber it. User can roll back by renaming the backup over the new file if v1.0 misbehaves.

### Changed

- **Four-package CLI lift: `Distribution`, `Diagnostics`, `Indexer`, `Ingest`** ([#244](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/244), [#245](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/245), [#246](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/246), [#247](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/247)): logic that powered four CLI commands — `setup`, `doctor`, `save`, `fetch` — moved out of `Sources/CLI/Commands/*` into four new SPM packages so MCP tooling, future agent-shell adapters, and tests can drive the pipelines without depending on `ArgumentParser`. CLI files become thin front-doors that parse flags + render progress.
  - **`Distribution`** (#246): download + extract + version-stamp pipeline. `SetupService` orchestrator emits `Event` callbacks (download progress / extract ticks / status changes); `ArtifactDownloader` (URLSession + progress callback), `ArtifactExtractor` (`/usr/bin/unzip` wrapper), `InstalledVersion` (status classification + stamp file r/w), `PackagesReleaseURL` (relocated from CLI). Drive-by fix: `InstalledVersion.classify` now requires all three DBs (search, samples, packages) to be present for non-`.missing` states — pre-#246 it ignored packages.db, so a partial install reported `.current` and skipped the redownload. `SetupCommand.swift` 478 → 177 LoC.
  - **`Diagnostics`** (#245): pure-data probes for SQLite + filesystem corpus. `Probes.userVersion` / `perSourceCounts` / `rowCount` / `countCorpusFiles` / `packageREADMEKeys` / `userSelectedPackageURLs` / `ownerRepoKey`, plus `SchemaVersion.format`. Zero external deps; opens DBs via `SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY`. `DoctorCommand.swift` 596 → 400 LoC. Foundation for a follow-up `HealthReport` + `DoctorService` so MCP can expose the same diagnostic data as a tool.
  - **`Indexer`** (#244): write-side counterpart to `Search`. Three indexer services (`DocsService` wraps `Search.IndexBuilder`, `PackagesService` wraps `Search.PackageIndexer`, `SamplesService` wraps `SampleIndex.Builder`) each emit per-stage `Event` callbacks. `Preflight` namespace hosts the #232 preflight pipeline (`preflightLines`, `checkDocsHaveAvailability`, `sampleDocsAvailability`, `countPackagesAndSidecars`) — used by both `cupertino save` (write-time prompt) and `cupertino doctor --save` (read-only health check). `SaveCommand.swift` 828 → 312 LoC + 229 LoC in `SaveCommand+Indexers.swift` (split to fit `type_body_length` 300-line ceiling). `--remote` mode stays in CLI for now; lifting it needs the underlying `RemoteIndexer` pipeline to grow a callback shape.
  - **`Ingest`** (#247 sub-PR 4a): package skeleton + `Session` helpers — five static lifted from `FetchCommand` (`clearSavedSession`, `requeueErroredURLs`, `requeueFromBaseline`, `enqueueURLsFromFile`, `checkForSession`) plus internals (`collectBaselineURLs`, `lowercaseDocPath`) and `FetchURLsError`. `FetchCommand.swift` 1279 → 1022 LoC. The seven `<Type>Pipeline` services (docs / packages / samples / evolution / archive / hig / availability) stay in CLI for now — those need a callback-based shape before they can lift cleanly. Tracked as follow-up sub-PRs 4b–4f in #247.
  - All four packages: `swift build` clean, full suite passes (1163 tests / 126 suites — 5 new tests added per package).
- **`cupertino read` unified across docs / samples / packages** ([#239](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/239) follow-up): a single command now dispatches to all three backends. URI scheme (`apple-docs://...`, `hig://...`, etc.) → docs (search.db). Slugified id with no `/` → sample project. `<projectId>/<path>` → sample file. `<owner>/<repo>/<path>` → package (read from `package_files_fts.content`, no on-disk corpus needed). `--source <name>` disambiguates sample-file vs. package paths. Logic lives in `Services/Commands/ReadService.swift`. `Search.PackageQuery.fileContent(owner:repo:relpath:)` added so `cupertino setup`-only installs (no `~/.cupertino/packages/` tree) work for package reads.
- **`cupertino search` emits read-full hints + `--brief` mode** ([#239](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/239) follow-up): every fan-out result now prints `▶ Read full: cupertino read <id> --source <name>` after the chunk (text), `- **Read full:** ...` (markdown), `readFullCommand` field (json) — uniform, source-aware. `--brief` flag truncates each chunk to 12 non-blank lines for triage; default stays full chunks. Footer adds `See also` (per-source drill-in commands) + tips (narrow with `--source`, platform-filter hint).

### Removed

- **`cupertino ask` subcommand removed; absorbed into `cupertino search`** ([#239](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/239)): two CLI commands serving overlapping needs collapsed into one. `cupertino search "<question>"` (no `--source`) now runs the SmartQuery fan-out across every available DB with reciprocal-rank-fusion ranking and chunked excerpt output — exactly what `ask` did. `cupertino search --source <name>` keeps its existing list-style output unchanged. The `--platform` / `--min-version` / `--per-source` / `--skip-docs` / `--skip-packages` / `--skip-samples` / `--packages-db` flags carried over from `ask`. JSON / markdown output formats also produce SmartQuery-shaped chunks now — the previous `UnifiedSearchService` path is gone. Pre-1.0 clean break, no alias — `cupertino ask` errors with `unknown command`. Subcommand count drops 15 → 14. `package-search` (hidden) stays as the packages-only shortcut. `SearchCommand.swift` was split alongside the merge: per-source runners moved to `SearchCommand+SourceRunners.swift`, fan-out plumbing + chunked printers to `SearchCommand+SmartReport.swift` (lint type-body-length compliance). CHANGELOG, docs (`docs/commands/ask/` deleted, `docs/commands/search/` expanded), and `CommandRegistrationTests` updated.

### Fixed

- **Sample search FTS5 query OR-joins instead of AND-joining every token** ([#238](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/238)): `SampleIndex.Database.searchFiles` and `searchProjects` were space-AND'ing every quoted token from the input, so a natural-language query like `"how do I animate a swiftui list"` resolved to `"how" "do" "I" "animate" "a" "swiftui" "list"` — implicit AND across seven phrases, no sample file matched all seven, samples returned zero. Lifted the tokenization helpers from `Search.PackageQuery` into a new `Shared.FTSQuery` namespace (`tokens(from:stopwords:)` + `build(question:)`) that strips stopwords and OR-joins. Both `SampleIndex.Database` paths now share that builder with `PackageQuery`. Drive-by on `Services.SampleCandidateFetcher`: emit project-level matches in addition to file matches — natural-language queries frequently score a project's title/README without lighting any single file's content. Smoke run: `cupertino ask "how do I animate a swiftui list" --skip-docs` now returns the SwiftUI-animation sample at position 1, with `Searched: packages, samples`.
- **`cupertino search --source samples` no longer fails when search.db is locked** ([#237](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/237)): the command was unconditionally fetching teaser previews from search.db even when scoped to samples-only. When another process held an EXCLUSIVE write lock (typically a long-running `cupertino save --docs`), the teaser fetch threw and the whole command aborted before samples results were rendered. Wrapped the teaser fetch in do/catch — on failure logs a one-line info note and falls back to empty `TeaserResults`. Samples results display unchanged. `ask --skip-docs` already had similar resilience via fetcher-failure-collapses-to-empty (#220).

### Added

- **Date-based schema-version helpers + doctor surfacing** ([#234](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/234)): new `Shared.SchemaVersion` namespace produces fixed-width 12-char `YYYYMMDDhhmm` strings (`make`, `now`, `components`, plus a `dateOnlyInt32` fallback for `PRAGMA user_version` and `iso8601Now` for human-readable audit fields). Each DB will switch over on its next real schema bump — keeps the `if currentVersion < N` migration ladder intact since old sequential ints sort below any reasonable date-style value. `cupertino doctor` gained a Schema-versions section that prints `PRAGMA user_version` from search.db, packages.db, and samples.db and labels each as date-style or sequential, so a stale machine in the multi-Mac sync setup is one command away from being obvious. 12 new tests cover fixed-width, round-trip, range validation, lex-ordering. Convention is custom — most SQLite ecosystems use sequential ints — but documented.
- **`--platform` / `--min-version` now scope `ask` results from samples + docs too** ([#233](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/233)): the filter is no longer packages-only. `SampleCandidateFetcher` accepts `availability:` and JOINs `projects` on `min_<platform>` in the SQL. `DocsSourceCandidateFetcher` accepts `availability:` and forwards to `Search.Index.search`'s existing `minIOS` / `minMacOS` / `minTvOS` / `minWatchOS` / `minVisionOS` params (which already do proper semver compare in memory). Swift-language-version sources (`swift-evolution`, `swift-org`, `swift-book`) silently drop the filter — their pages don't carry OS-version columns; that axis lives under #225. The unfiltered-source notice in `ask` now lists only those three sources, since apple-docs / apple-archive / hig / packages / samples all honour the filter.
- **samples.db now persists per-sample availability** ([#228](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/228) phase 2): schema bumped 2→3 (no migration; `save --samples` always wipes and rebuilds). `projects` table gains `min_ios` / `min_macos` / `min_tvos` / `min_watchos` / `min_visionos` / `availability_source` columns plus indexes; `files` gains `available_attrs_json` carrying the per-file `@available(...)` occurrences as a JSON array. `SampleIndexBuilder` now passes the parsed `Package.swift` deployment targets into the `Project` row and the per-file attribute list into each `File` row, so the same data the sidecar JSON writes is also queryable from SQL. `availability_source = "sample-swift"` when populated; `NULL` when the sample shipped no `platforms: [...]` block (typical of Apple's Xcode-project samples). Round-trip tests cover both columns.
- **`cupertino save` preflight + `cupertino doctor --save`** ([#232](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/232)): `save` now prints a per-scope summary before any DB write — which source dirs are present, how many packages have `availability.json` sidecars, whether the docs corpus has been annotated by `fetch --type availability` — then prompts `Continue? [Y/n]` and lets the user bail. Auto-skips the prompt when stdin isn't a TTY (CI / pipes) and via `--yes`. The same summary is reachable read-only as `cupertino doctor --save` for users who want to know "is save ready?" without committing to a run. `checkDocsHaveAvailability` was refactored into pure helpers (`sampleDocsAvailability`, `firstJSONFile`, `jsonContainsAvailability`) with named-constant tunables so tests can pin behavior.

### Changed

- **`cupertino save` now builds all three databases by default; `cupertino index` removed** ([#231](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/231)): scope flags `--docs` / `--packages` / `--samples` select a subset; with no scope flag passed `save` builds search.db, packages.db, and samples.db in that order, skipping any source directory that's missing with an info log. The standalone `cupertino index` command is gone — its body lives under `save --samples` (with `--samples-dir`, `--samples-db`, `--force` options renamed for symmetry). Pre-1.0 clean break, no alias. Subcommand count drops 16 → 15.

### Added

- **`cupertino ask` now includes the samples corpus** ([#230](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/230)): new `Services.SampleCandidateFetcher` adapts `SampleSearchService` to the `Search.CandidateFetcher` protocol so `Search.SmartQuery`'s reciprocal-rank fusion fans out across `apple-docs`, `apple-archive`, `hig`, `swift-evolution`, `swift-org`, `swift-book`, **packages**, and **samples** in one call. New `--skip-samples` flag and `--samples-db <path>` override mirror the existing `--skip-packages` / `--packages-db` shape. Default behaviour: samples included whenever `samples.db` exists. Smoke run: `ask "swiftui list animation" --skip-docs` returns sample matches with FTS5-extracted snippets alongside package hits.
- **`--platform` / `--min-version` filters on `package-search` and `ask`** ([#220](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/220)): two new options that restrict packages results to those whose declared deployment target is compatible with the named platform. Values: `iOS`, `macOS`, `tvOS`, `watchOS`, `visionOS` (case-insensitive). Both flags are required together; one without the other errors out. Filter pushes through `PackageFTSCandidateFetcher` → `Search.PackageQuery.AvailabilityFilter` → SQL JOIN on `package_metadata.min_<x>` with a lexicographic compare. Lex compare is correct for current Apple platform versions (iOS 13+, macOS 11+, tvOS 13+, watchOS 6+, visionOS 1+); old macOS 10.x with multi-digit minors would mis-order but no priority package currently targets that. Packages with NULL annotation source are dropped (no annotation = unknown = excluded). `ask` only filters its packages source — apple-docs / hig / archive / evolution remain unfiltered.
- **packages.db now persists availability data** ([#219](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/219) follow-up): `save --packages` reads each package's `availability.json` (produced by `fetch --type packages --annotate-availability`) and writes flat columns into `package_metadata` (`min_ios`, `min_macos`, `min_tvos`, `min_watchos`, `min_visionos`, `availability_source`) plus a `available_attrs_json` column on `package_files` carrying the per-file `@available(...)` occurrences as a JSON array. Mirrors the `docs_metadata` availability shape from #192 sec. C, so callers can filter packages by minimum platform without parsing JSON. Schema bump 1→2 with idempotent ALTER-TABLE migration; existing v1 DBs pick up the columns on next open. Verified on the May 2026 priority closure: all 183 packages have `availability_source = 'package-swift'` populated. The `available_attrs_json` column is NULL when no annotation file was present, so callers can distinguish "not annotated" from "annotated with no attrs".
- **`fetch --type packages --annotate-availability`** ([#219](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/219)): new opt-in stage 3 of the merged packages fetch. Walks every `<owner>/<repo>/` subdir under `~/.cupertino/packages/` and writes a per-package `availability.json` capturing the `Package.swift` `platforms: [...]` deployment-target block plus every `@available(...)` attribute occurrence in `Sources/` and `Tests/` (file path + line + parsed platform list). Pure on-disk pass — no network. Idempotent. Runs whether or not stage 2 just downloaded fresh archives, so you can re-annotate an existing corpus by combining `--skip-metadata --skip-archives --annotate-availability`. Smoke run on the May 2026 priority closure: 183 packages annotated, 13.5k `@available` attrs in 12s. Regex-based scanner — multi-line attrs aren't handled and hits aren't tied to specific declarations; the AST upgrade (extending `ASTIndexer.SwiftSourceExtractor`) is a follow-up.

### Fixed

- **Dev binary now writes to `~/.cupertino-dev/` automatically** ([#218](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/218)): `make build-debug` and `make build-release` now drop a `cupertino.config.json` next to the produced binary with `{ "baseDirectory": "~/.cupertino-dev" }`. Previously a locally-built dev binary silently fell through to brew's `~/.cupertino/`, clobbering the installed user's data mid-flight (hit on the 2026-05-03 packages-overhaul rebuild). Brew bottles still ship only the binary — released installs continue to resolve to the standard `~/.cupertino/`. Override at invocation: `make build-debug DEV_BASE_DIR=~/some-other-dir`.
- **`PriorityPackagesCatalog` additively merges new embedded entries into existing user files** ([#218](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/218)): `ensureUserSelectionsFileExists` used to no-op once `~/.cupertino/selected-packages.json` existed, so adding new seeds to `PriorityPackagesEmbedded.swift` never propagated to existing installs. A Dec 2025 user file frozen at the priority list from then was missing the April 2026 `mihaelamj/*` additions despite the embedded JSON having them. Fix: on every load, set-diff against the user file (matched on `owner.lowercased()/repo.lowercased()`) and append any embedded entries the user file is missing. Idempotent, never removes, prints a one-line `📥 selected-packages.json: added N new priority entries…` summary on the run that adds anything. User deletions don't stick — that's a deliberate trade-off (separate "removed" list would be needed; called out in the #218 comment).
- **FetchCommand "Next:" hint now points at the real save flag** (`save --packages`, not the non-existent `save --type packages`).

### Changed

- **Merged `fetch --type packages` and `fetch --type package-docs`** ([#217](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/217)): a single `--type packages` now runs the Swift Package Index metadata refresh and the priority-package GitHub archive download back-to-back. New `--skip-metadata` / `--skip-archives` flags gate either stage individually; passing both is an error. The two were already adjacent in every workflow, shared the `~/.cupertino/packages/` output dir, and the `package-docs` name was misleading (it pulled whole archives, not READMEs). The `package-docs` raw value is gone — invocations using it now error with the help text. `directFetchTypes` count dropped 7→6, `allTypes` 10→9. `--type all` still covers both stages because the merged command is what runs.

### Added

- **Binary-co-located config file** ([#211](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/211)): new `Shared.BinaryConfig` reads an optional `cupertino.config.json` from the directory of the running executable (symlinks resolved). One key supported today: `baseDirectory` (tilde-expanded). When present, every default path in `Shared.Constants.default*` plus `SampleIndex.defaultDatabasePath` and `SampleIndex.defaultSampleCodeDirectory` redirects under that base, so `fetch`, `save`, `serve`, `ask`, `doctor`, and the samples DB all follow uniformly without env vars or per-command flags. Missing file or any decode error falls through to the existing `~/.cupertino/` default, so installs without the file behave identically to before. Use case: run a dev build alongside an installed brew binary against separate corpora. Contract test (`BasePathDerivationTests`, `SampleIndexBasePathDerivationTests`) asserts every default path derives from `defaultBaseDirectory`, so a future getter that bypasses it fails at test time.
- **`cupertino resolve-refs` subcommand** ([#208](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/208)): post-process pass that walks a directory of saved `StructuredDocumentationPage` JSON files (typically from a `--discovery-mode json-only` crawl), harvests a global `identifier → title` map from each page's `sections[].items[]`, and rewrites every `doc://com.apple.<bundle>/...` marker in `rawMarkdown` to the readable title. Pure post-process by default: no network, no recrawl. Markers pointing to pages no other page references are left intact and surfaced via `--print-unresolved`.
- **`resolve-refs --use-network` and `--use-webview` flags** ([#208](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/208)): opt into a second pass that fetches titles for the still-unresolved markers via Apple's JSON API (`--use-network`), or also falls back to WKWebView when the JSON API can't serve a marker (`--use-webview`, slow, macOS only).
- **`fetch --urls <path>` flag** ([#210](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/210)): read URLs from a text file (one per line) and enqueue each at depth 0, with the crawler following links from each up to `--max-depth`. Set `--max-depth 0` to fetch only the listed URLs with no descent. Useful for fetching a fixed list of URLs another corpus has but this one is missing, without re-spidering. `#`-prefixed and blank lines are ignored.
- **Crawl depth stamped on every saved page**: each `StructuredDocumentationPage` JSON now carries the depth at which it was discovered, so corpus auditing and per-depth analysis no longer need to recompute from link graphs.

### Fixed

- **Exponential retry backoff for crawler page failures** ([#209](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/209)): a transient page failure used to retry immediately, hammering the same URL on the same network blip. Backoff is now 1s / 3s / 9s / capped at `Shared.Constants.Delay.retryBackoffMax` for attempts 1+. Capped, so a hard-failing page can't stall the crawl indefinitely.
- **Hardcoded `~/.cupertino/` paths in user-facing strings** (#211 follow-up): four offenders that would print the wrong path under a `BinaryConfig` override now interpolate the resolved path. `SearchIndex.swift` schema-mismatch errors (versions 5 and 12 migration thresholds) now suggest `rm <actual-search-db-path> && cupertino save`. `FetchCommand` priority-packages "not found" message now prints `Shared.Constants.defaultPackagesDirectory.appendingPathComponent("priority-packages.json").path`. `IndexCommand` discussion text and `--sample-code-dir`/`--database` help defaults, plus `CleanupCommand` `--sample-code-dir` help default, all interpolate `SampleIndex.default*` and `Shared.Constants.defaultSampleCodeDirectory` so `--help` reflects the actually-configured paths.
- **URL canonicalization — case axis** ([#200](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/200)): `URLUtilities.normalize` now lowercases the URL path. Apple's docs server is case-insensitive on the path, so `/documentation/Cinematic/CNAssetInfo-2ata2` and `/documentation/cinematic/cnassetinfo-2ata2` return the same content. The crawler previously treated each casing as a distinct URL — visited set held both, queue was inflated ~3× with case duplicates (62 % of queue entries on the April 2026 in-flight crawl), ETA estimates were correspondingly off. Fragment and query stripping unchanged. Path-segment dash-vs-underscore variants are NOT collapsed: at least one Apple framework (`installer_js`) legitimately uses underscore in its canonical path, and observed dash/underscore "duplicates" (e.g. `professional-video-applications` vs `professional_video_applications`) turned out to be Apple serving distinct documentation sets at similar slugs, not URL aliases. That axis will be handled at the search-index save layer if and when real duplicates are observed; the canonicalization patch alone is conservative.

### Added

**Search quality — field-weighted BM25 with AST-extracted symbols (#192 sections C + D, subsumes #176)**

The retrieval technique is **BM25F** (field-weighted BM25, Robertson/Zaragoza/Taylor 2004) over a structured 8-column FTS5 index (`uri`, `source`, `framework`, `language`, `title`, `content`, `summary`, `symbols`), augmented with a Swift AST symbol extractor. Public API surface: `Search.SmartQuery` (see "smart-query wrapper" below). Underneath:

- `Search.DocKind` taxonomy: 10-case enum (`symbolPage`, `article`, `tutorial`, `sampleCode`, `evolutionProposal`, `swiftBook`, `swiftOrgDoc`, `hig`, `archive`, `unknown`) populated at index time by `Search.Classify.kind(source:structuredKind:uriPath:)` — a pure deterministic function. Stored in new `docs_metadata.kind` column.
- `docs_metadata.symbols` denormalized blob + `docs_fts.symbols` FTS column. Both populated by an AST pass (`SwiftSourceExtractor` over both code-block content AND declaration lines) so a query like `Task` ranks the Swift `Task` struct page above prose mentions of the word "task". The BM25F weight vector is `bm25(docs_fts, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 10.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0)` — title dominates (10×), symbols next (5×), summary (3×), framework (2×).
- `idx_kind` index for per-kind routing queries.
- `Search.Index.extractCodeExampleSymbols` + `recomputeSymbolsBlob` (private) — a single source of truth that reads `doc_symbols` and writes both denormalized columns, so declaration-derived and code-block-derived symbols flow into ranking uniformly.

**smart-query wrapper — `Search.SmartQuery`, exposed as `cupertino search` (#192 section E, #239)**

The user-facing label is **smart-query** (lowercase prose). The technique is **reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)** of per-source BM25F rankings — Cormack, Clarke, Büttcher 2009. Originally shipped as `cupertino ask`; merged into the default `cupertino search` fan-out per #239 before tag.

- Public-facing CLI: `cupertino search "<question>"` runs the question across every available source (apple-docs, apple-archive, hig, swift-evolution, swift-org, swift-book, packages) in parallel and returns a fused top-N. No `--source` flag needed.
- `Search.SmartCandidate` source-agnostic result struct. `Search.CandidateFetcher` protocol with one method, `fetch(question:limit:)`, per source. Concrete impls: `PackageFTSCandidateFetcher` (wraps `Search.PackageQuery.answer`), `DocsSourceCandidateFetcher` (wraps `Search.Index.search` for any apple-docs-style source).
- `Search.SmartQuery` fans fetchers out via `TaskGroup`, fuses per-source rankings via RRF (k=60, the standard default). Failing fetchers collapse to empty — one dead DB never takes the whole query down. Per-fetcher limit caps noisy sources before fusion so a verbose source can't drown out a strong single hit.
- `cupertino package-search` (hidden) is now a thin wrapper on `SmartQuery` with a single `PackageFTSCandidateFetcher`, so ranking tweaks land in one place.

**MCP protocol bump — 2025-11-25 (#192 section G, subsumes #139)**
- `MCPProtocolVersion` 2025-06-18 → **2025-11-25**. `MCPProtocolVersionsSupported` widened to `[2025-11-25, 2025-06-18, 2024-11-05]` for backward-compat across three negotiation hops.
- New `Icon` struct (`src` / `mimeType` / `sizes`) Codable + Hashable + Sendable.
- `Implementation` gains optional `icons: [Icon]?`. Nil by default; legacy 2025-06-18 / 2024-11-05 handshakes decode legacy payloads unchanged.
- `MCPServer.init(name:version:icons:)` accepts an optional icons array. `cupertino serve` now advertises a 64×64 PNG via `data:image/png;base64,...` URI, embedded in `CupertinoIconEmbedded.swift` following the same Swift-literal pattern as #161 (no asset bundle, no symlink resolution).
- `assets/cupertino-icon-64.png` ships in the repo as the source-of-truth (1671 bytes, systemBlue rounded square with a white "C"). Placeholder; a designer can replace.

**Doctor diagnostics (#192 section F)**
- `cupertino doctor` reports both `search.db` and `packages.db` presence, file size, row counts. Reads `PRAGMA user_version` directly (without going through `Search.Index`, whose init throws on incompatible versions) so the user sees the actual on-disk version even when it's incompatible.
- Schema-mismatch path: `older` → "rm + cupertino save" hint, `newer` → "brew upgrade cupertino" hint. Exits non-zero so CI / smoke tests fail loudly.
- `packages.db` row counts (packages, package_files) + bundled `databaseVersion` for at-a-glance install verification.

**Distribution + packaging (#192 section B)**
- All three databases ship in a **single bundle** — `cupertino-databases-vX.zip` on `mihaelamj/cupertino-docs`. v1.0.0 is the first release where `packages.db` is included alongside `search.db` and `samples.db`. (Earlier scoping had a separate `mihaelamj/cupertino-packages` companion repo for `packages.db`; that proved to be needless complexity. Setup is one download, one extract.)
- `cupertino setup` is the **single command** that owns every database. Downloads + extracts the bundle from `cupertino-docs` and stamps the version file on success. No granularity flag — the previous `cupertino packages-setup` is removed.
- `cupertino-rel databases` (the release tool) bundles all three DBs together. Hard-fails if `packages.db` is missing under `--base-dir` unless `--allow-missing-packages` is passed; lets a release runner publish a partial bundle in genuinely time-sensitive cases without making it the default. (#259)
- `Shared.Constants.App.docsReleaseBaseURL` is the only release URL constant.

**Per-URL JSON-then-WebView fallback (`fetch --type docs`)**
- `cupertino fetch --type docs` does a single pass through the queue, trying Apple's JSON API for each URL and falling back to WKWebView when a page has no JSON endpoint. **One of cupertino's coverage advantages over single-pass JSON-only MCPs** — every URL gets a chance at both transports without doubling the queue. (The fallback was already implemented in `Crawler.swift`; the previous "two-pass" orchestration in `FetchCommand` was redundant — it ran the same crawler twice — and is now removed along with the dead `--use-json-api` flag.)
- **Auto-resume by default**: if `metadata.json` has an active session matching the start URL, `cupertino fetch` picks it up without any flag. The previous `--resume` flag was just a log-message switch and is removed.
- **`--start-clean`**: new flag. Wipes `metadata.json`'s `crawlState` (queue + visited set) before running so the crawl starts fresh from the seed URL. Page-level state on disk is preserved — combine with `--force` to also re-fetch unchanged pages.
- **Crash-safe metadata save**: `JSONCoding.encode(_:to:)` now writes with `.atomic` (temp + rename), so a kill mid-save can never leave `metadata.json` corrupt. Mid-save corruption was the one failure mode that could make a multi-day crawl unresumable.
- `defaultMaxPages` constant raised 15,000 → **1,000,000**. Effectively uncapped for full Apple-corpus crawls (~50–80k pages); previous 15k default would silently truncate at ~15–30% coverage.

**Reproducible re-crawl pipeline (#192 section I scaffolding)**
- `scripts/recrawl.sh` orchestrates the full v1.0 re-crawl: wipes stale DBs + crawl manifests + per-source raw output dirs (true clean slate for schema bumps), then runs phases 1–10 sequentially with named markers (`=== Phase N/10: <name> — START HH:MM:SS ===`) so a tail-following watcher can spot stage transitions and per-phase wall clock at a glance.
- Phase order: docs → evolution → swift → hig → archive → packages → package-docs → code → save → doctor. `code` (sample-code with WKWebView sign-in) is intentionally last so the long automated phases run unattended.
- `make test-clean` Makefile target wraps `clean + test` for the SwiftPM stale-build SIGTRAP escape hatch.

**Crawler quality + steerability**
- **`fetch --discovery-mode <auto|json-only|webview-only>`**: `auto` (default) preserves the existing JSON-primary + WKWebView-fallback behaviour. `json-only` runs the JSON API and skips the fallback (fastest, narrowest discovery). `webview-only` runs WKWebView for everything (slowest, broadest discovery, matches pre-2025-11-30 behaviour). Lets the user trade coverage for speed without code changes.
- **`fetch --baseline <path>`**: on startup, URLs present in a known-good baseline corpus directory (e.g. a prior `cupertino-docs/docs` snapshot) but missing from the current crawl's known set are prepended to the queue, so a resumed crawl recovers gaps without a full recrawl. Path comparison is case-insensitive (mirrors #200 normalisation).
- **`fetch --retry-errors`**: re-queues URLs that errored before save (visited but missing from the pages dict). Use after a filename or save bug is fixed to retry only the affected pages without re-crawling the whole corpus. Prepended so retries go first.
- **Filename-length cap**: extremely long Apple framework paths used to produce filenames that exceeded the OS limit and silently dropped pages on save. Filenames now cap with a content-derived suffix so the URL stays the unique key while the on-disk filename stays valid.
- **DocC link discovery walks the full `references` dict**: previous crawler followed only direct identifiers in `topicSections`/`seeAlsoSections`, missing references reachable through nested item dicts. The walk now recurses through every value in `references` so frameworks with deep cross-linking (e.g. Foundation) discover the full transitive set in one pass.
- **Queue dedup at enqueue time**: visited-set + queue-set membership check moved to the enqueue path so the same URL isn't pushed multiple times. Combined with #200 case normalisation, the April 2026 in-flight crawl's queue dropped from 518k entries to 198k unique URLs without losing coverage.
- **Per-page sync work wrapped in `autoreleasepool`**: long crawls used to leak Foundation autoreleased objects across thousands of pages, growing RSS until the OS killed the process around hour 12 of a multi-day run. Each page's parse + transform + save block is now its own autorelease scope, so RSS stays flat across an indefinite crawl.

**From the original v0.11.0 scope (pre-consolidation)**
- **Transitive dependency resolution for `fetch --type package-docs`** (#184): each seed is walked through its `Package.swift` (libraries commit this; most lockfiles are `.gitignored`), then `Package.resolved` as a fallback for apps. Dependencies on `github.com` are added to the fetch queue. Non-GitHub URLs, missing manifests, and malformed manifests are counted and skipped. Opt out with `--no-recurse`. Terminates via canonical-name dedupe.
- **GitHub redirect canonicalisation**: aliases like `apple/swift-docc` and `swiftlang/swift-docc` collapse into one entry instead of double-indexing. Cached at `~/.cupertino/.cache/canonical-owners.json`; one API call per unique repo, lifetime.
- **Persisted resolved closure** at `~/.cupertino/resolved-packages.json` with parentage + checksum. Re-fetch reuses the cache unless seeds changed or `--refresh` is passed. Answers "why is this package in my index?".
- **User exclusion list** at `~/.cupertino/excluded-packages.json`. Hand-edit to drop discovered-via-dep packages from future closures.
- **Parallel resolver** dispatches manifest fetches in batches of 10. A 200-package closure shrinks from ~3 min wall time to a few tens of seconds.
- **Per-branch manifest cache** at `~/.cupertino/.cache/manifests/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/Package.swift` with 24h TTL. 404s cached as zero-byte sentinels.
- **SPM registry id counting** (`.package(id: …)`, SPM 5.8+) — surfaces in the resolver summary as `Skipped (SPM registry id)` rather than silently dropped.
- **TUI promote / exclude actions** (`x` toggle exclusion, `p` promote discovered-via-dep to seed). Visual indicators: `[*]` seed, `[X]` excluded, `[+]` discovered, `[ ]` none.
- **Expanded bundled `priority-packages.json`** from 36 to 135 seeds: 43 Apple (incl. `swift-syntax` swiftlang move, `swift-foundation`, `swift-markdown`, `swift-http-types`, `swift-nio-extras`, `swift-configuration`, `swift-distributed-tracing`); 92 ecosystem covering full Vapor + Hummingbird, expanded Point-Free, swiftlang, SSWG, tooling (SwiftFormat, SwiftLint, XcodeGen), Soto, SwiftUI Introspect, Tuist, plus project-specific seeds.

**Swift Testing proposals indexed alongside Swift Evolution (#178, contributed by @farkasseb)**
- `cupertino fetch --type evolution` now also crawls `proposals/testing/` from `swiftlang/swift-evolution`, so ST-prefixed proposals (Swift Testing) are first-class alongside SE-prefixed ones. Status regex updated to handle both prefix conventions; 404s on the testing subdir are handled gracefully (an empty testing/ dir is valid for older snapshots).
- `Search.SearchIndexBuilder` indexes ST proposals into the same `evolution` source so they're searchable via `cupertino search` and `cupertino ask`.
- New tests: `SwiftEvolutionCrawlerTests` (149 lines) + ST coverage in `CupertinoSearchTests` + `ServeTests`.

### Changed

- **`cupertino setup` default now re-downloads** (#168). The previous short-circuit-if-databases-present behaviour is opt-in via `--keep-existing`. Each successful download stamps `~/.cupertino/.setup-version` so subsequent runs report `current` / `stale` / `unknown` / `missing`. Motivation: users were stranded on stale DBs after `brew upgrade cupertino`.
- **Resource catalogs compiled into the binary** (#161): the four JSON catalogs are embedded as Swift raw-string literals under `Packages/Sources/Resources/Embedded/` instead of shipped as a `Cupertino_Resources.bundle`. The bundle-missing-on-Homebrew failure mode is fundamentally gone — there is no bundle. Obsoletes the `b9bc70a` symlink-resolution fix.
- **`swift-packages-catalog` slimmed to URL list only**: the embedded catalog carries just the 9,699 package URLs (~530 KB), not the previous metadata blob (~3.4 MB). Metadata returns via `packages.db` distribution. Tracked in [#194](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/194) for full removal in v1.1.0 once `packages.db` is the canonical source.
- **Schema bump 10 → 12** (single user-visible jump, but two intermediate steps internally). v11 added `kind` + `symbols` to docs_metadata via ALTER TABLE. v12 added `symbols` to `docs_fts` (BREAKING — FTS5 can't ALTER columns). Existing v10/v11 DBs throw on open with a clear `rm + cupertino save` rebuild hint. Aligned with the v1.0 full re-crawl plan, so end users only see one transition.
- **`make test-clean` Makefile target** — `clean + test` in one command. Escape hatch for the Swift 6.2 / macOS 26 SwiftPM incremental-build bug where adding a method to an actor leaves stale `.o` files and async dispatch lands in the wrong slot. Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` Troubleshooting + `mihaela-agents/Rules/ai-agent-rules/testing.md`.
- **stdout line-buffered when piped**: `Cupertino.main()` calls `setvbuf(stdout, nil, _IOLBF, 0)` so `cupertino fetch ... | tee` flushes per-line instead of every 4–8 KB. No more "appears hung for 5 minutes then dumps a chunk" surprise on long crawls.
- **`fetch --type package-docs` now extracts a filtered tarball, not a single README**: `PackageArchiveExtractor` (Core actor) pulls `https://codeload.github.com/<owner>/<repo>/tar.gz/<ref>` (HEAD → main → master fallback) and extracts README, CHANGELOG, LICENSE, `Package.swift`, all of `Sources/` + `Tests/`, every `.docc` article and tutorial, `Examples/` / `Demo/` directories, plus a per-package `manifest.json`. Same on-disk layout as before (`~/.cupertino/packages/<owner>/<repo>/`), but materially richer payload. Drives this shift: 5-line stub READMEs (vapor/leaf, etc.) made the prior README-only index nearly worthless for AI-agent "how do I use X?" queries — the source itself is now the last-resort fallback.
- **`cupertino fetch --type package-docs` hidden from public help**: still functional, but no longer advertised — typical users get package data via the curated `packages.db` bundled in the `cupertino-docs` release zip. The full crawl is for re-building artifacts, not for end users.

### Fixed

- **Homebrew resource bundle lookup** (#161): now fundamentally solved because there is no bundle.
- **`fetch --type package-docs` honours user selections** (#107): `PriorityPackagesCatalog` first access copies the bundled `priority-packages.json` to `~/.cupertino/selected-packages.json` so TUI / manual edits take effect immediately.
- **Swift.org indexing drops valid pages** (#110): `metadata.json` was being decoded as a `StructuredDocumentationPage` and failing on the missing `url` key. `findDocFiles` now filters it out. Separately, `is404Page` was over-aggressive — only flips the verdict on short pages (<500 chars) for the ambiguous "page not found" phrase, so the Swift Book's "The Basics" pages discussing error handling are no longer misclassified.
- **Sample-code auth WebKit window** (#6, partial). Window now appears and navigates: `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.regular)` nil-crash fixed (`NSApplication.shared` instead); delegate attached before `webView.load()`; spoofed Safari UA dropped (`idmsa.apple.com` was 403'ing it). `AuthFlowCoordinator` auto-detects sign-in via `myacinfo` cookie. Fresh interactive sign-in still has CoreAnimation quirks in a bare Swift CLI host; full replacement ([#193](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/193), public JSON endpoints) is scoped to v1.1.
- **BM25F single-word capitalized type queries** (#181): the FTS5 index was previously column-uniform (every column weight 1.0), so Mach kernel `task_*` docs outranked the Swift `Task` struct page on a literal `Task` query. Switching to **field-weighted BM25 (BM25F)** with title 10× and AST-extracted symbols 5× now makes `Task` rank the Swift Task struct above Mach `task_info`, and `View` rank the SwiftUI View protocol above generic prose. Full case-sensitivity comes with the v1.0 re-crawl.
- **Cross-machine resume path resolution**: `FetchCommand.checkForSession()` was returning `metadata.crawlState.outputDirectory` — an absolute path captured on the machine that originally ran the crawl. After rsyncing `~/.cupertino/docs/` to a second host (different home dir, mounted volume), that saved path pointed at nothing, so `cupertino fetch` would silently start writing to a phantom directory under the wrong home. Now returns the directory where `metadata.json` was actually located — by definition the live output dir. Means a multi-day crawl can be migrated mid-run between machines via plain rsync + a `git pull` of the cupertino binary.
- **Claude Code plugin install command** (PR #173 by @gpambrozio): `marketplace.json` source corrected from `"."` to `"./"` to match working-marketplace convention; README plugin install instructions updated to use the slash-command + `owner/repo` form instead of a CLI command with a full git URL.
- **Deterministic id and contentHash for `StructuredDocumentationPage`** ([#199](https://github.com/mihaelamj/cupertino/issues/199)): `id` was a fresh `UUID()` per fetch and `contentHash` was `sha256(of: rawSourceBytes)` (Apple JSON, HTML, or markdown frontmatter — all carrying volatile cache / build / timestamp metadata that didn't reach our parsed output). Two crawls of the same Apple-side content produced different hashes, `Crawler.shouldRecrawl` always returned true, and every re-fetched page falsely registered as ♻️ Updated. Spot-checked Rotation3D and CGContext against the prior corpus — content was byte-identical after stripping volatile fields. Fix: `id` now derives from SHA-256 of the URL string (`StructuredDocumentationPage.deterministicID(for:)`); `contentHash` now hashes a canonical structured payload (`canonicalContentHash`) excluding `id`, `crawledAt`, `contentHash` itself, and `rawMarkdown` (which embeds `crawledAt`). Three transformers updated (`AppleJSONToMarkdown`, `HTMLToMarkdown`, `MarkdownToStructuredPage`). Five new regression tests in `SharedTests/ModelsTests`. Verified end-to-end: three back-to-back live fetches of `documentation/spatial/rotation3d` produced byte-identical id and contentHash, third fetch was correctly skipped. **Migration:** existing on-disk corpus carries pre-#199 hashes; the next crawl re-saves each existing page once with the canonical hash, then becomes idempotent. Subsequent ♻️ Updated counts will then map to actual Apple-side documentation edits.

**Test coverage added for v1.0 fetch / resume behavior**
- `Packages/Tests/SharedTests/JSONCodingTests.swift::concurrentWritesAreAtomic` — race a writer against 8 concurrent readers on a 256 KB file. Without `.atomic`, readers observe `Unexpected end of file` decode errors; with `.atomic`, 1,600 reads × 200 writes are all clean. Verified to fail when `.atomic` is removed.
- `Packages/Tests/CLICommandTests/FetchTests/ResumeTests.swift` — 11 tests covering: `--start-clean` no-op when no metadata exists; `--start-clean` wipes `crawlState` while preserving stats; `--start-clean` leaves valid JSON and is idempotent; fresh `CrawlerState` auto-loads an active session; fresh `CrawlerState` reports no session when `crawlState` is absent; `--start-clean` + reload produces no active session; save → reload via fresh instance round-trips; `checkForSession` returns the *found* directory not the saved path (cross-machine portability); `checkForSession` rejects start-URL mismatch / inactive sessions / missing metadata; `checkForSession` ignores even a coincidentally-existing foreign path. Two of these were proven to fail under deliberate sabotage of the corresponding code path.

### Removed

- `cupertino setup --force` flag — use `--keep-existing` or the new default-downloads behaviour.
- `cupertino packages-setup` (hidden) subcommand — collapsed into the unified `cupertino setup`.
- `cupertino fetch --use-json-api` flag — was never read by the Crawler (per-URL JSON-then-WebView fallback was always unconditional). Dead config; removing it deletes the `useJSONAPI` field from `Shared.CrawlerConfiguration`.
- `cupertino fetch --resume` flag — auto-resume is the default now. The flag was a log-message switch only, doing nothing functional.
- `FetchCommand.runDocsTwoPassCrawl()` — ran the same crawler twice (force-fresh, then resume-and-find-nothing). The "two-pass" branding was misleading; the per-URL fallback already gave full coverage in one pass.
- `Cupertino_Resources.bundle` shipped artifact — no longer generated, no longer copied by `install.sh` / `release.yml` / the Homebrew formula.
- `SwiftPackagesCatalog.topPackages(limit:)`, `.activePackages(minStars:)`, `.packages(license:)` — relied on metadata fields no longer present on the slimmed URL-only catalog. Metadata-driven queries will come back via `packages.db`.

### Internal

- `Search.DocKind`, `Search.Classify`, `Search.SmartCandidate`, `Search.CandidateFetcher`, `Search.SmartQuery`, `Search.PackageFTSCandidateFetcher`, `Search.DocsSourceCandidateFetcher`, `Search.FusedCandidate`, `Search.SmartResult` — new public surfaces under `Packages/Sources/Search/`.

- `CupertinoIconEmbedded.dataURI` for serverInfo advertising.
- `CLI.Commands.AskCommand`, `CLI.Commands.PackagesReleaseURL`, `CLI.Commands.SetupCommand.SetupStatus` — new CLI internals.
- **Test count: 961** in 96 suites, 0 failures, ~40s on clean build. New suites added during this release cycle: `DocKindTests` (19), `DocKindIntegrationTests` (13), `BM25TitleWeightingTests`, `CodeExampleSymbolsTests`, `IndexBuilderSymbolsIntegrationTests`, `SmartQueryTests`, `DocsSourceCandidateFetcherTests`, `CupertinoResourcesTests`, `PackagesReleaseURLTests`, `SwiftEvolutionCrawlerTests` (#178), `ResumeAndStartCleanTests` (11 cases covering auto-resume, `--start-clean`, and cross-machine `checkForSession` portability). Updated: MCP protocol tests for 2025-11-25 + Icon + Implementation icons + legacy decode, schema-version assertions to 12, BM25 tests to 8-weight vector, doctor schema-version helpers, CLI subcommand count, `JSONCodingTests.concurrentWritesAreAtomic` (regression test for atomic metadata save).

- `scripts/recrawl.sh` — full re-crawl orchestration, named phases, idempotent wipe.
- `scripts/demo.sh` — single-run live presentation script for demo recordings (no slides, just the binary).
- **`mock-ai-agent` polish**: stdout now streams via `bytes.lines` for ordered delivery (previously buffered, so AI-like back-and-forth printed out of sequence on slow stdin), UTF-8 chunk truncation that could split a multi-byte glyph mid-character is fixed, and a new `--quiet` mode hides protocol noise for clean demo recordings.
- 6 GitHub issues closed (`#18` colors, `#20` E2E MCP tests, `#109` search-all/search-hig — all already done or superseded). 3 v1.0-deliverable labels (`v1.0: distribution`, `v1.0: symbols`, `v1.0: mcp`) + `wishlist` label applied to ~20 speculative pre-v1.0 issues.

### Known issues / deferred

- **Sample-code auth WebKit** (#6 partial; full replacement #193) — fresh interactive sign-in still has CA rendering quirks in the bare Swift CLI host. v1.1 swaps to public JSON endpoints; for v1.0 use the existing macOS user session if it has signed in via Safari recently.
- **MCP `search` tool sectioned-vs-blended split** — MCP clients still get the per-source `UnifiedSearchService` shape (good for human-readable chat); only the new `cupertino ask` CLI uses cross-source rank fusion. Unifying these two presentations behind `SmartQuery` is a v1.1 polish.
- **G6 Tasks abstraction** for long-running operations not wired — re-crawl + full-index run synchronously without MCP Tasks-protocol progress reporting. Defaults are fine; v1.1 polish.
- **#177 low-signal AST symbol filtering** — operators, boilerplate names show up in symbol search. Quality-of-life cleanup post-1.0.
